gf3svyy,If it’s exercised you will have to buy 100shares to cover. Just make sure you buy it back if it starts to fall too low. Check out Investopedia “naked put”. But yes technically it’s 0 not unlimited. Still a lot of risk to take on for pretty limited profit potential depending on when exp date is. The chances of it moving against you are more likely than it giving you a large pay day.
